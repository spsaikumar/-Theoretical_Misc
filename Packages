Conda is a powerful package manager and environment manager 

Conda allows you to create separate environments containing files, packages, and their dependencies that will not interact with other environments.


MacOS, Linux - Terminal window

conda --version

conda update conda

conda create --name <env-name> <package_name(to install it)>
eg: conda create --name snowflakes biopython


conda activate <env-nmae>           
eg: conda activate snowflakes

#To see a list of all your environments, type:
conda info --envs

#Change your current environment back to the default (base):
conda activate 
conda activate base


#Create a new environment named "snakes" that contains Python 3.9
conda create --name <env-name>  <package>=x.x
eg: conda create --name snakes python=3.9


#Verify which version of Python is in your current environment:
python --version
