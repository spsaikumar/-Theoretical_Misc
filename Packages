Conda is a powerful package manager and environment manager 

Conda allows you to create separate environments containing files, packages, and their dependencies that will not interact with other environments.


MacOS, Linux - Terminal window
Windows - Command line prompt

conda create --name <env-name> <package_name(to install it)>
